            <div class="about-content">
                <div class="about-text">
                    <p>Founded in 2010, The Modern Frame began as a small passion project by art enthusiasts Sarah and Michael Chen. What started as a modest space in downtown has grown into one of the city's most respected contemporary art galleries.</p>
                    
                    <p>Our mission is to bridge the gap between emerging artists and art lovers, creating a space where creativity flourishes and new voices are heard. We believe that art should be accessible to everyone, and we work tirelessly to make contemporary art approachable and engaging.</p>
                    
                    <p>Over the years, we've hosted over 200 exhibitions, featuring works from more than 500 artists from around the world. Our gallery has become a cultural hub, hosting regular events, artist talks, and educational programs for the community.</p>
                    
                    <blockquote>
                        "Art is not what you see, but what you make others see." - Edgar Degas
                    </blockquote>
                    
                    <p>This quote embodies our philosophy at The Modern Frame. We don't just display art; we create experiences that inspire, challenge, and transform our visitors' perspectives on contemporary culture.</p>
